## Introduction ##

We present the first search for gravitational-waves from sub-solar mass compact-binary mergers
which allows for non-negligible orbital eccentricity. Sub-solar mass black holes are a signature of
primordial origin black holes, which may be a component of dark matter. To produce gravitationalwaves binary coalescences, primordial black holes may form close binaries either in the early universe
or more recently through dynamical interactions. A signature of dynamical formation would be the
observation of non-circularized orbits. We search for black hole mergers where the primary mass is
0.1 − 7M and the secondary mass is 0.1 − 1M. We allow for eccentricity up to ∼ 0.3 at a dominantmode gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz for binaries with at least one component mass > 0.5M.
We find no convincing candidates in the public LIGO data. The two most promising candidates have
a false alarm rate of 1 per 3 and 4 years, respectively, which combined is only a ∼ 2.4σ deviation
from the expected Poisson rate. Given the marginal statistical significance, we place upper limits on
the rate of sub-solar mass mergers under the assumption of a null observation and compare how these
limits may inform the possible dark matter contribution.
